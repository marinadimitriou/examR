Examination Project in R

My solution to our exam project in R for the "Introduction to Programming in Python and R for Biosciences" course.
Grade: VG "passed with distinction" (the highest possible grade).

Instructions for this project can be found in the file "R Exam Instructions.pdf".
This project mainly included calculations and visualization of pharmakokinetic parameters.
